# aid-management-application
This is the term assignment of our second-semester object-oriented C++ programming course. I uploaded this as a demonstration of what I have been able to achieve through my study program. I have included the link to the original repository.

An application that manages the list of goods that need to be shipped to the disaster area. The client application tracks the quantity of items needed, tracks the quantity on hand, and stores the information in a file for future use.  
The types of goods that need to be shipped are of two categories;
• Non-Perishable products, such as blankets and tents, which have no expiry date. We refer to products in this category as Product objects.
• Perishable products, such as food and medicine, that have an expiry date. We refer to products in this category as Perishable. 
OOP concepts used in this assignment: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.

Allocator.cpp is provided by the professors to test our code.

Honesty declaration:
The reason that I did not use the original git repository from the course is because I do not want this to be found by students who would potentially copy my solution. As I’m still also a student, this could impact me as well. If you are a fellow student, please do not copy my code in your assignment. You are welcome to contact me for help instead.
